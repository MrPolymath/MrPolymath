👋 Hi, I'm Daniel Carmona, but people know me as Dani.

- 🏡 I was born in Barcelona, Spain.
- ❤️ I love starting projects from scratch.
- 🚀 Bootstraped [Rapidand](https://rapidand.com), the only e-commerce in Andorra, to +15M in ARR.
- 💪 Did YC S22 with [Aldara](https://aldara.com), the modern version of an HOA manager.
- 🚀 Working on something new
- 🖌️ I like sketching and I paint watercolors.
- 🎹 I have multiple pianos and syntesizers, guitars, ukeleles, harmonicas and microphones. Also a flute and a saxophone. I play them all, but none very well.
- ⛵ I sail as much as I can. I've sailed from Venice to Barcelona. I spend at least 3 weeks in the water every year. I can also hold my breath for 3 minutes and dive 20m deep.
- 🎭 I started using the name @MrPolymath from very young, because I aspire to be a [Polymath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath) some day. I regret doing so because it's very pretentious. I can only say that I'm a [Philomath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philomath). I won't change the username now because people know me like this.
